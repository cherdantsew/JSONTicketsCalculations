# JSONTicketsCalculations
A test task to calculate average flight time out of .json file and 90th percentile of flight times.
I was given json file and I was supposed to parse Tickets objects out of it so as to calculate average flight time from A to B and also to calculate the 90th percentile out of all flight durations
